# An Odin wrapper library for [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev)

You can either `jokeapi.get_joke()` or `jokeapi.get_jokes()`. Not very complicated I don't think.

Check out the various options at the official [documentation](https://jokeapi.dev/#try-it). They should map quite nicely if do I say so myself.

### Dependencies
This library depends on laytan's [HTTP library](https://github.com/laytan/odin-http)
